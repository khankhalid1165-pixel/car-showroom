The Car Showroom Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and streamline the daily operations of a car showroom. The main objective of this project is to provide a digital platform that simplifies the management of car inventory, customer details, sales records, and bookings while improving overall user experience and reducing manual work.

The system is divided into two main modules: Admin and User. The Admin module allows administrators to add, update, and delete car details such as model, brand, price, features, and availability. Admins can also manage customer information, track sales, and view reports to analyze performance. This helps in maintaining a well-organized database and ensures quick access to important information.

The User module enables customers to browse available cars, view detailed specifications, compare models, and book test drives or make purchase inquiries. A simple and user-friendly interface ensures smooth navigation and better customer engagement.

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS for the front end, while Python (Django) or Node.js can be used for backend development. The database is handled using MySQL to securely store all information.

The system offers features such as search and filter options, responsive design, and real-time updates. By automating showroom operations, it reduces paperwork, saves time, and minimizes errors.

Overall, the Car Showroom Management System provides a modern, efficient, and interactive platform for both customers and administrators, enhancing productivity and delivering a professional digital solution for car showroom management.
